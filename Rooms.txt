You are now outside and it is now raining. You see two paths. You can go WEST or NORTH from here.

You are now in an abandoned church. You see someone is inside "praying". You may not want to disrupt them. You can go  EAST or SOUTH from here.
Room 2
You are now an enormous kitchen, you see dirty pots and pans. You have the option to go WEST or SOUTH.
Room 3
You are now in the woods, and you here something in the woods. Wanna play Scooby-Doo? Or use common-sense and leave it alone? You may go NORTH or SOUTH.

Room 5
You enter the hallway again and see another door leading ahead of you. WEST or NORTH.
